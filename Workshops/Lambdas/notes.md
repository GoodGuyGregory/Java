## Java Lambdas

Functions as First class citizens with Lambdas, introduced in Java 

in order to create anonymous functions Java Developers created an interface which allowed for the use of functions outside of the class defintions, or SAM (Single Abstract Method)

Methods outside of classes are called **Functions** and when you have a method outside of a class it is refered to as a function. 

Collections got an awesome foreach loop to the consumer interface class.
