## Java Objects

**j-shell**

REPEL for Java introduced in Java 9

Opening Classes with Jshell is very easy use the `/open <classname>` make sure you are in the directory where your class exisits

**Objects**

Objects in java have two main things: 
* State
* Behavior

This has the ability to abtract the working process from the client

**YAGNI**

adding complexity to objects before they are built is a common mistake programmers make and it is a common phrase to emphasise this idea of not over complicating development. `KISS` or Keep it simple stupid.

`You.Aint.Gonna.Need.It.`

**Exceptions**

IllegalArgumentExceptions thrown are known as Runtime Error Handlers
